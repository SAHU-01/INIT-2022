## Style guide

### Spacing
All elements should be sized and positioned based on a 12px grid system. Acceptable fractions of one unit are 6px and 3px.

### Colors
Use [Google's Material color palette](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-palette). The primary color is "Blue Gray" and the secondary "Blue." Errors should be "Orange."

### Transition & Animation
Transitions and animations should last 150ms and use `ease-in-out` unless inappropriate. Use `@keyframe` animations whenever possible.
