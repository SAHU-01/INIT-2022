# Contributing to list

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the awesome production machine learning list!

The key things to bare in mind when contributing a new list are the following:

* This is not an exhaustive listing
* Repository should ideally be at least six months old and actively maintained
* Project should ideally have 100+ stars
* All contributions must be done in alphabetical order relative to the section
* The library should not be repeated across more than one section
* In order to propose a new section, please add an issue first for discussion

Thank you again, if you have any questions please feel free to open an issue.
